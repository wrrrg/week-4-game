        <p>You're a waiter who has a very different amount of income each month. You don't always have very much money! Try to pay your basic living expenses without going into serious debt. You have to pay four things each month: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rent - you have to pay this once a month. (Note: your rent is going to be the same every month, so I hope you get a good deal!)</li>
          <li>Food - you have to pay for your groceries four times a month.</li>
          <li>Utilities and Gas - you have to pay this once a month.</li>
          <li>Medical Expenses - you have to pay this at LEAST once a month.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some months will be good - if you end the month with extra, you can have a savings account! Maybe new shoes. Maybe a 401k. Who knows? The problem is, other than rent, you don't know exactly how much each of these is going to cost every month. Good luck!</p>
